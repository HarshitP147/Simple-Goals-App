<h1>Greetings!!</h1>

This is the repository containing the source code for a simple goals Application written in <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>, a JavaScript framework my Meta.
This project was originally made for ELC project for my college work. But by doing further work, more features can be added such as notifications and user accounts and much more!!

This project requires expo CLI to work. So for that, type `npm install expo-cli -g` to globally install the expo CLI or `npm install expo` on your own directory.

To get started, `git clone` this repository and on your root folder

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies on your root folder.

<h3>Note</h3>
This app contains one issue that is not really a bug or an error but some wrong functionality. If the list is empty, it still asks whether to delete all the items or not instead of prompting that the list is empty.
<hr>

Some other features like asking the deadline for the goal, reminder notifications or signing accounts and authorization and can be added in future. This is just a basic app.

<h4>Do not change the .gitignore file as it contains all the dependencies that should be ignored by git </h4>
